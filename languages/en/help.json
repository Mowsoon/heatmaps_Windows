    "description_1": "Signal strength tells you how good or bad your Wi-Fi connection will be. It's measured in <strong>dBm</strong> (a negative number).<br><br>It's simple: <strong>the closer the number is to 0, the better the signal.</strong><br><ul><li><strong>-30 to -50 dBm:</strong> Excellent (you are close to the access point).</li><li><strong>-50 to -65 dBm:</strong> Very Good (streaming, video calls OK).</li><li><strong>-65 to -75 dBm:</strong> Fair (web browsing OK, but might buffer).</li><li><strong>-75 to -90 dBm:</strong> Poor (unstable connection or dropouts).</li></ul>",
    "title_2": "What is the 'Channels' map for?",
    "description_2": "Think of Wi-Fi channels like <strong>lanes on a highway</strong>.<br><br>If there are too many networks in the same lane (on the same channel), it creates a <strong>'traffic jam'</strong>. Everyone slows down, even if their signal is strong!<br><br>This map shows you the most-used 'lanes' (channels) in each spot. If you see a '5' on a point for Channel 6, it means 5 Wi-Fi networks are competing on that channel. The best practice is to set your Wi-Fi to use a less crowded channel (e.g., one where you see '1' or '2')."
